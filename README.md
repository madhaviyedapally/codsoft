Welcome to the To-Do List Manager project! This application is developed in C++ as part of my internship at CodSoft. The To-Do List Manager is designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks, providing functionality to create, view, update, and delete to-do items.
Features
Add New Tasks: Easily add new tasks with a description and priority level.
View Tasks: Display all tasks in a structured format.
Update Tasks: Modify existing tasks to reflect changes.
Delete Tasks: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks from the list.
